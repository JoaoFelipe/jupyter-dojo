# Jupyter Dojo

A JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook extension for rendering unittest results.

This project consists in a nbextension for Jupyter Notebooks and a labextension for Jupyter Lab. It adds the following features to Jupyter:
* Test status in toolbar (result of [IPython Unittest](https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/ipython-unittest))
* Argument --previous, to move to previous cells after execution
* Timer, pair programming log, function generation for coding dojo sessions
* Syntax highlight for `%%write {mode}` magic

## Prerequisites

* JupyterLab ^0.30.0 and/or Notebook >=4.3.0

## How to Install

If you want to install the *Jupyter Notebook* extension:
```bash
pip install jupyter_dojo
jupyter nbextension install --symlink --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
```

If you want to install the *Jupyter Lab* extension:
```bash
jupyter labextension install @jupyter_dojo/labextension
jupyter lab build
```

Note that Jupyter Lab extension API is not stable yet. Thus, it is very likely that future version will break this extension.

## Development

```bash
pip install -e .
# For JupyterLab
jupyter labextension link labextension
jupyter lab build
# For Notebook
jupyter nbextension install --symlink --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix jupyter_dojo
```
